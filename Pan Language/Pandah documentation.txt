--Documentation for the Pandah language--

Chapter 1. Hello World
A pandah program always starts itself in the "Main" function of the "Program" class.
to create a running program one should first create this Program class.
this is is done by typing "class Program" in the first line.
like many other languages the class and its name is followed by 2 brackets.
the positioning of these brackets are completely left to the user.
An example:
	class Program
	{

	}

This example uses the backets on a new line.

As said before the next thing a default pandah program has is a main function.
A main function looks like this:
	function Main <- void
	{

	}

The fist thing that should stand out is the use if the keyword "function".
